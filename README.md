## 📖 About the Project

The **Password Manager** is a simple and secure desktop application built using Python and Tkinter.
It helps users generate strong passwords, store them safely, and quickly retrieve them whenever required.

Earlier, people stored passwords in notes or reused the same weak passwords across websites — which is risky and hard to manage.

This application makes password management easy by providing:
- Automatic strong password generation
- Secure storage using JSON file
- Quick search functionality
- Simple and clean GUI using Tkinter
- Autofill options and clipboard copy for convenience
This project is perfect for understanding GUI development, data storage, event handling, and user validation in Python.
